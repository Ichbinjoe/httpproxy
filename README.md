Implements a programmable HTTP Forwarding Proxy with Many-To-One server
relationships, including user-agent rewriting. Also supports optional proxy
authentication.

This package wraps github.com/elazarl/goproxy for its many features and needs.
It is controlled and interacted with via a REST style interface.

This code is absolutely use at your own ~~risk~~ peril - I wrote this for a very
specific purpose and made it more general for public release.
